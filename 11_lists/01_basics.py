# nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# print(nums)
# nums.append(5)
# print(nums)
# nums.append(6)
# print(nums)

# even = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# even.pop()    # removes last element by default but if i wanna remove something specific, i just need to write the index of the shit inside the paranthesis
# print(even)
# even.pop(1) # this means i wanna remove the element present on index 1 that is 4 in this case
# print(even)

# odd = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
# odd.insert(10)

# rehan = ["code", "ball", "chaos"]
# rehan.insert(0, "love")   # list.insert(index, element)
# print(rehan)

# irl use case can be prioritizing a particular task like i just did above. urdgent task goes to the very top. eg love is above everything for me
# adding next song in the playlist without disturbing the order of the already existing songs

# IMPORTANT: if index is larger than length list, then the element is added at the last

# social_media = ["insta", "whatsapp", "twitter"]
# social_media.insert(20, "facebook")
# print(social_media)


# students = ["a", "b", "c"]
# rank_of_b = students.index("b")
# print("rank of b is",rank_of_b)

# irl use can be a hospital queue, which patient is in which room, finding rank of students etc

# food = ["chocolate", "biryani", "crossiant", "samosa", "pizza", "burger", "pizza", "chocolate", "biryani", "samosa", "samosa", "pizza"]
# duplicate = food.count("chocolate")
# print(duplicate)

#  irl use can be counting number of users of a subscription, identifying if an element is present multiple times, voting system
